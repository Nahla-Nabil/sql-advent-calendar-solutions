-- Difficulty: hard

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: npn_users
--   user_id: INT
--   user_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: npn_messages
--   message_id: INT
--   sender_id: INT
--   sent_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

WITH daily_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(sent_at) AS message_date,
        sender_id,
        COUNT(*) AS message_count
    FROM npn_messages
    GROUP BY DATE(sent_at), sender_id
),
ranked_users AS (
    SELECT 
        message_date,
        sender_id,
        message_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY message_date ORDER BY message_count DESC) AS activity_rank
    FROM daily_counts
)
SELECT 
    ru.message_date,
    u.user_name,
    ru.message_count
FROM ranked_users ru
JOIN npn_users u ON ru.sender_id = u.user_id
WHERE ru.activity_rank = 1
ORDER BY ru.message_date;
